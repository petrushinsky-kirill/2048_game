# 2048 Game
This is an implementation of the popular game 2048, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows players to connect tiles with the same numbers to achieve a score of 2048.

## ðŸ“– About the project
In this project, I implemented the functional logic of the game 2048, including tile generation, merging, moving, and scoring. The game automatically ends if no more moves can be made. Basic styles and interactivity are also provided to improve the user experience.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies used
- HTML5: basic game structure.
- CSS3: stylization of the playing field and tiles.
- JavaScript: implementation of the main game logic, including:
  - Generating new tiles.
  - Checking possible moves.
  - Scoring.
  - Ending the game.
## ðŸ•¹ Main functionality
1. Playing field:
- 4x4 field.
- Initial generation of tiles with numbers 2 or 4 in random places.
2. Tile movement:
- Use arrow keys to move tiles.
- Automatic merging of tiles with the same numbers.
- Generation of a new tile after each move.
3. Winning and ending the game:
- Winning when reaching the tile with the number 2048.
- Notification of loss if it is no longer possible to make a move.
4. Scoring:
- The sum of points increases depending on the values â€‹â€‹of the merged tiles.
## âœ¨ Features
Implementation of game logic from scratch: all algorithms (merging, movement, checking the game state) are written manually.
Responsive design: the playing field and tiles look harmonious on different screens.
